    "# Q1: What is multiprocessing in Python? Why is it useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing in Python is the capability to create and run multiple processes in parallel. Each process runs independently and has its own memory space, allowing for true parallelism. It is useful for tasks that can be parallelized, such as CPU-bound operations, as it takes advantage of multiple processor cores or CPUs to enhance performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2: Differences between multiprocessing and multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory: Processes have separate memory space, while threads share the same memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): Multiprocessing avoids the GIL issue present in CPython, allowing true parallel execution. In multithreading, the GIL can limit parallelism, especially in CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallelism: Multiprocessing achieves parallelism by using multiple processes, which can run on different processors or cores. Multithreading achieves concurrency but not necessarily parallelism within a single process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: Multiprocessing may introduce more overhead due to the creation and management of separate processes. Multithreading is often simpler but can face challenges like race conditions and deadlocks.\n",

    "# Q4: What is a multiprocessing pool in Python? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "A multiprocessing pool in Python is a set of worker processes that are created to perform parallel processing. It allows you to distribute tasks among the worker processes, providing a convenient way to parallelize and distribute work across multiple processors.\n",
